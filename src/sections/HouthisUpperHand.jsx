      Sana'a, where most industries and international organizations have historically been headquartered, will give the Houthis a good position in the economic war as their capital. The fact that the more densely populated markets were under their control gave them leverage over the government to maintain their grip on the Yemeni economy. In the meanwhile, the IRG enjoyed international recognition and support, which it sought to use to weaken the Houthis. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Without oil or sufficient import taxes, the IRG is struggling to maintain sufficient revenues for the budget needed to run its territories. The anti-Houthi front is also fragmented, with multiple actors claiming sovereignty over different parts of the south. Poor performance and <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2024-fiscal-transparency-report/yemen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='text-gray-800 underline'>failure to uphold anti-corruption measures</a> led to <a href="https://south24.net/news/news.php?nid=3109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='text-gray-800 underline'>delays</a> in promised grants,
      and the IRG will often find itself unable to issue payroll or keep basic services running. 
       <a href="https://www.alayyam.info/news/9ZY6DWQO-N85H3G-BA47" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='text-gray-800 underline'>Protests are taking over major cities in the south</a> , 
      with a widespread sense of uncertainty about the future.
  
      </p>
      <p>
      The Houthis, who are also unable to provide stable services or payroll while cracking down on critics are increasingly claiming a regional role
      by attacking maritime traffic through the Red Sea and attacking Israeli cities in support of the Palestinians in the Gaza war. 
      The Houthis seem to try to <a href="https://www.dw.com/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%83%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%BA%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D9%86%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B0%D9%87%D9%85/a-68976670" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='text-gray-800 underline'>gain popularity</a> in the face of public dissatisfaction with their regime. 
      These latest attacks will add more players to the Yemeni front with the US, Israel and allies targeting the Houthis.
      </p>
      <p>
      These recent developments seem to have little impact on the Houthis who are continuing their attacks.
      After all, the Houthis are coming out of ten years of bombardment and blockade not losing and capable of pushing their own terms. 
      Just last summer, the IRG<a href="https://sanaacenter.org/publications/analysis/23062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className='text-gray-800 underline'>backed down </a> from revoking the licenses of six banks still headquartered in Sana’a. 
      The backdown was pressured by Saudi Arabia, which gave in to threats of fresh Houthi attacks both on Yemeni and Saudi targets.
