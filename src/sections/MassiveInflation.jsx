      The loss of oil revenues, tax revenues,
      and general mistrust in the fragmented economy led to a severe deficit in the public budget.

      limiting transactions to those involving the pre-2016 prints. Since the IRG only controls less than a quarter of consumer markets,
      this tactical move flooded the IRG economy with the new prints spiraling further inflation.
